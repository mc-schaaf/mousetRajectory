\title{Number of times a point is crossed}
\usage{
point_crosses(numeric_array, relevant_point = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{numeric_array}{Array of numbers ordered by their time of appearance.}

\item{relevant_point}{Number which has to be crossed.}
}
\value{
Number of times that \code{numeric_array} crosses
the \code{relevant_point}.
}
\description{
Checks how often a number (\code{relevant_point}) is being
crossed by an number sequence (\code{numeric_array}).
}
\details{
The order of the supplied vectors indicates timeadjacency.
}
\examples{
x_vals <- c(-1, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1)
point_crosses(x_vals, 0)
point_crosses(x_vals, 1)
point_crosses(x_vals, -1)
