# mousetRajectory: Trajectory Analyses for Behavioural Scientists

Tool helping psychologists and other behavioural scientists to analyze mouse movement (and other 2-D trajectory) data. Bundles together several functions computing spatial measures (maximum absolute deviation, area under the curve, sample entropy) or providing a shorthand for often-used procedures.


## Installation

You can install mousetRajectory from CRAN with

``` r
install.packages("mousetRajectory")
```

Alternatively, you can keep up to date and install the latest development version of mousetRajectory from [github.com/mc-schaaf/mousetRajectory](https://github.com/mc-schaaf/mousetRajectory) with:

``` r
if(!require("devtools")){install.packages("devtools")}
devtools::install_github("mc-schaaf/mousetRajectory")
```


## Function Overview

Currently, the following functions are featured:

* Preprocessing:
  * `is_monotonic()` checks whether your timestamps make sense and warns you if they don't.
  * `is_monotonic_along_ideal()` checks whether your trajectories make sense and warns you if they don't.
  * `time_circle_left()` tells you the time at which the starting area was left.
  * `time_circle_entered()` tells you the time at which the end area was entered.
  * `point_crosses()` tells you how often a certain value on the x or y axis is crossed. 
  * `direction_changes()` tells you how often the direction along the x or y axis changes.  
  * `interp1()` directs you to the interpolation function from the awesome `signal` package. Thus, you do not have to call `library("signal")`. Such time-saving, much wow. Also, not having to attach the `signal` package avoids ambiguity between `signal::filter()` and `dplyr::filter()` in your search path.
  * `interp2()` is a convenience wrapper to `interp1()` that rescales the time for you.
* Spatial measures:
  * `starting_angle()` computes (not only starting) angles.
  * `auc()` computes the (signed) Area Under the Curve (AUC).
  * `max_ad()` computes the (signed) Maximum Absolute Deviation (MAD).
  * `curvature()` computes the curvature.
  * `index_max_velocity()` computes the time to peak velocity, assuming equidistant times between data points.
  * `index_max_acceleration()` computes the time to peak acceleration, assuming equidistant times between data points.
* Other measures
  * `sampen()` computes the sample entropy.
